# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pocophone F1

## Uninstallation

### Why is this needed?
If you want to uninstall windows use this instead of deleting partitions manually to avoid human error + writing a whole dedicated guide to just uninstalling.

If you want to relock your bootloader you'll need your partition table to be stock.

### Prerequisites
- [Restore.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u8TOgzLl93_TPm3LvdNVQz2m0MO-JW67/view?usp=drive_link)

- Boot to recovery and flash [Restore.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u8TOgzLl93_TPm3LvdNVQz2m0MO-JW67/view?usp=drive_link)
- Reboot to recovery again and select Wipe > Format Data > Type `yes`
- Reboot your system

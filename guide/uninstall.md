# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pocophone F1

## Uninstallation

### Why is this needed?
If you want to uninstall windows this is used instead of deleting partitions manually to avoid human error + writing a whole dedicated guide to just uninstalling.

If you want to relock your bootloader you'll need your partition table to be stock.

### Prerequisites
- [RestorePartition.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J2fUTRvM5o7jQc824EJpFgBg7W8shiLg/view?usp=sharing)


### Uninstall instructions
> [!Important]
> This will delete all your Android data.

- Boot to recovery and flash [RestorePartition.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J2fUTRvM5o7jQc824EJpFgBg7W8shiLg/view?usp=sharing)
- Reboot to recovery again and select Wipe > Format Data > Type `yes`
- Reboot your system

## Finished!
